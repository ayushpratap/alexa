# Creating Cards for your Users

In addition to responding to your users with Alexa's voice, you can also provide them with additional information by using a "card."  Cards are found on the Home screen of the Alexa app, and you can also view your cards at http://alexa.amazon.com, after logging in.

If you haven't already read up on emitting speech back to the user, you might want to start there before getting too deep into this topic.
