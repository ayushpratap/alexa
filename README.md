#What is an Alexa skill?

Skills to Alexa are like apps on your phone.  There's a [marketplace](http://amazon.com/skills), you can add them to your account, and they make your great device even better.  Skills make it easier to [order a pizza](https://www.amazon.com/Dominos-Pizza-LLC/dp/B01B5G99CC/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1480978760&sr=1-1&keywords=dominos), play a [game of Jeopardy](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Pictures-Television-Jeopardy-J6/dp/B019G0M2WS/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1480978784&sr=1-1&keywords=jeopardy), or even [find out how much gas is left in your tank](https://www.amazon.com/Automatic/dp/B017OJL1IE/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1480978809&sr=1-1&keywords=automatic).

#How do I build a skill?

Skills are made up of two parts, just like most software you use today.  There's the server-side logic: the code that makes your skill take action, and there's the user interface, which is made entirely of your user's voice commands.  These two pieces together comprise a skill for Alexa.  To get started building your first skill, we recommend trying our [Fact Skill Tutorial](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-fact).  It will walk you through each step of the process, explaining each of the important pieces of skill construction along the way.

Once you've published your first skill, we highly recommend checking out the sections highlighted at the top of this page.  There's much more to learn about [Voice User Interfaces](https://github.com/jeffblankenburg/alexa/tree/master/voice_user_interface), [testing your skills](https://github.com/jeffblankenburg/alexa/tree/master/testing), [certification](https://github.com/jeffblankenburg/alexa/tree/master/certification), and even [measuring how and when your skill is getting used](https://github.com/jeffblankenburg/alexa/tree/master/analytics)!
